# ExePlore

# Project Description
This is the repo for group 2s group software enginnering project taken as a compulsory second stage module at the University of Exeter. The specification for this app was to design a piece of software for the university to encourage both students and staff to explore the university campus. There for the app was appropriately named ExePlore to convey the message that this was an exploration game set in Exeter. This game is created with a space theme in mind to make the exploration of the campus more fun. The way in which the app works is that users will be expected to scan QR codes across the campus to collect locations and earn points and badges while doing so. Students and staff alike will then be motvated to compete against one another by having access to a leaderboard. The app made use of the google maps javascript API to provide the map, the users current location and marker clusters which show the user all the avalible locations that can be scanned. The main issue we encountered on our project was scope creep where we wanted to implement features that we didn't have the time for. 

# How to run our project
You run our project by going to the following link:
```url

```
and creating an account. Once you have created an account you can navigate our app using the navigation bar at the top of the application. Use of the google maps javascript API has allowed for the users current location to be retrived by a button at the bottom of the map and the user can additionally use street view to help them navigate the campus.
